## Federated Identity Management for Governments


The benefits of eGovernment have been established, in that they help streamline government processes as well as provide a means to interact with a nation’s citizens. Governments can offer services like tax filing, social security management, document processing, electronic voting and also provide a degree of unified administration. However, an e-government system must reply on and gather data about a country’s citizens in order to provide personalized public services, a requirement that raises privacy concerns. In this project, a solution is developed in which the identity of users is managed they the users themselves through an authorized entity to which the eGovernment federates authentication and authorization using OpenID Connect.
